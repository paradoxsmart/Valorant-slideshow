## About
This is a small project I whipped up to practice a little Js while learning 😁. 
It's nothing complex, just a self-scrolling slide show that changes the image every 10s or so.

## How to View
It's a small practice project so it's not deployed live.
To view locally simply clone the repo and run the [index.html](index.html) file and it should run directly on your browser.

## Tools 🛠
I build this completely with:
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
